# Age-calculator

## The challenge
Users should be able to:
- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g 31/04/1991 ( there are 30days in April)

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on the device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Built with:
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla javascript

  ## What I learned
  I learnt how to use new methods such as getMonth() in the javascript
  I also learnt how to use Boolean to write a javascript function.
  I also learnt how to use the span element to write a hidden message that appears as an error, that is, when needed
